Hi! 😁

I'm Dean, I'm currently just a beginner but i hope i'll improve soon and that i'll progress quickly.

Right now this account is only  dedicated to getting this weeks progress dumped into it, but i'll try to  work on it more often later.
I'm a first year student at horizon college in the Netherlands and currently working on improving my php work.
I hope this information is enough and i hope you have a nice day!
